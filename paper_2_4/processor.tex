\section{Parallel Processor Architecture}
\label{sec:processor}

In this paper, we introduce a generic parallel processor con\-cept,
where the processor is assumed to support the following features:

1. Superscalar. The processor has multiple execution units that provide instruction-level parallelism by allowing several
operations to be executed simultaneously.

2. Pipeline. Complementary to superscalar, pipelining divi\-des individual instructions into a sequence of processing steps,
e.g., retrieving operands, execution, and storing the result. 
Pipelining improves the throughput of execution units unless
data dependencies prevent effective pipelining.

3. Single core. Modern processors have multiple processing units operate simultaneously. Focus of this paper is optimizing single-core performance over short blocks of data.

4. SIMD vector processing. A single-core superscalar proce\-ssor supports short vector operations that the processing units can apply the
same instruction simultaneously to multiple data units.
