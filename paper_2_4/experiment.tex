\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:experiment}

% To measure the performance of our proposed algorithm, we consider a general PC by using only single CPU and thread.
% The SIMD operation is realized via C++ programming and by the mean of vector class library (VCL).
% In VCL, two lengths of SIMD vectors can be used, i.e., 4 and 8. To get the better parallelism,
% we choose $M=8$. Recall that the matrix of data passed through the proposed functions is of size $M$ by $M$.

% \subsection{Rounding Error Issue}

% should we put the discussion of rounding error issue here or before the proposed algorithm?
% may be latter. Thus now I just show the particular solution.
